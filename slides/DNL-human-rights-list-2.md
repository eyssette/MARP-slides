# Freedom of association

---
<!-- _class: fppp  -->
This right is the individual right to come together with other individuals and collectively express, promote, pursue and defend common interests. The ability to organise is an important means by which citizens can influence their governments and leaders. The right has been most defined and elaborated in international labour law given the particular links between these rights and the ability of workers to secure their economic and social status. More specifically the freedom of assembly is understood in a political context : mass protest is a potent symbol of the exercise of this right.

# Right of asylum

---
<!-- _class: fppp -->
This rights is an ancient juridical notion, under which a person persecuted for political opinions or religious beliefs in his or her own country may be protected by another sovereign authority, a foreign country, or church sanctuaries. Political asylum is similar, but not identical, to modern refugee law, which deals with massive influx of population, while the right of asylum concerns individuals and is usually delivered on a case-to-case basis. There is overlap between the two because each refugee may demand political asylum on an individual basis.

# Right to self-determination

---
<!-- _class: fppp -->
Nations have the right to freely choose their sovereignty and international political status with no external compulsion or interference. The principle does not state how the decision is to be made, or what the outcome should be, whether it be independence, federation, protection, some form of autonomy or even full assimilation. Neither does it state what the delimitation between nations should be — or even what constitutes a nation. In fact, there are conflicting definitions and legal criteria for determining which groups may legitimately claim this right.
